> **A reproducible `targets` pipeline for analyzing multi-scale engagement dynamics in conspiracy-theory communities on Voat**

---

## Overview

This repository contains a fully reproducible computational pipeline analyzing how **social feedback**, **routine behavior**, and **community context** shape user engagement in conspiracy-theory (CT) communities on Voat—a Reddit-like platform that operated from 2014 until its shutdown on December 25, 2020.

**Key insight:** CT communities endure not because of what members *believe*, but because of how they *behave*. Habit formation transforms reward-seeking into automatic routine, while ideological alignment provides resilience against social punishment.

## Research Questions

| RQ | Question | Method |
|----|----------|--------|
| **RQ1** | How does responsiveness to social feedback vary with routine behavior and community context? | Linear mixed-effects regression (log-transformed posting latency) |
| **RQ2** | Which factors predict upshifts toward conspiracy-theory communities? | GAMM with binomial link, smooth terms for content cues |
| **RQ3** | How does persistence vary with social feedback, routine, and community? | Cox proportional hazards with time-varying coefficients |

---

## Key Findings

### RQ1: Habit Decouples Behavior from Feedback
Users with strong posting routines show **reduced sensitivity to social reinforcement**. Lagged net votes predict shorter posting latency overall (β = -0.02, p < .001), but this effect attenuates for regular (β = 0.021, p < .001) and bursty posters (β = 0.018, p < .001). Community type (CT vs. non-CT) does not modulate this decoupling.

### RQ2: Group Cues Reduce CT Migration
Counterintuitively, exposure to **group-oriented narratives** (actor/action attributions) *decreases* likelihood of transitioning to CT spaces (edf = 7.1, χ² = 319.3, p < .001). Trait cues (secrecy/pattern/threat) show no significant effect. Habitual engagement increases baseline susceptibility (steady: β = 0.70; bursty: β = 0.68).

### RQ3: Ideology Buffers Dropout—Habit Does Not
Negative feedback increases dropout hazard (HR = 1.12, p < .001). Surprisingly, **habitual posting increases dropout risk** (steady: HR = 1.15; bursty: HR = 1.40, both p < .001)—unless buffered by CT alignment. CT subverses show **80% lower dropout hazard** compared to non-CT spaces (HR = 1.80 for non-CT, p < .001).

## Dataset

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Unique users | 2,711 |
| Subverses (communities) | 4,435 |
| Comments | 2,099,255 |
| Submissions | 49,550 |
| Time span | 2014-06-19 to 2020-12-25 |

### Key Variables

| Variable | Description | Construction |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `controversy` | Reddit-style controversy score | `(u+d) × min(u,d) / max(u,d)` |
| `habit_class` | Posting pattern | Burstiness > 0.7 → bursty; else top 25% frequency → steady regular; else occasional |
| `sv_score` | Subverse conspiracy score | Word2Vec embedding + PCA projection on seed CT communities; ≥ 0 = CT |
| `transition_to_ct` | Weekly CT upshift | Binary: mean SV score increased from previous week |
| `tenure` | Account age stratum | Short (≤365d), Mid (365-1000d), Long (>1000d) |

## Reproducibility

### Quick Start (with Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nika-akin/ICWSM-CT-multilevel.git
cd ICWSM-CT-multilevel

make init      # Build container and restore renv
make pipeline  # Execute the full targets pipeline
make reports   # Render Quarto manuscripts and supplementary materials
make poster    # Compile conference poster (requires pdflatex)
```

### Local Setup (without Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nika-akin/ICWSM-CT-multilevel.git
cd ICWSM-CT-multilevel

# Restore exact package versions
R -e "renv::restore()"

# Run the pipeline
R -e "targets::tar_make()"

# Render reports
R -e "quarto::quarto_render('reports/manuscript.qmd')"

# Visualize pipeline dependencies
R -e "targets::tar_visnetwork()"
```

### Pipeline Architecture

The `targets` pipeline includes **40+ interdependent targets** organized into three analytical streams:

```
Data Preparation → Feature Engineering → [RQ1 | RQ2 | RQ3] → Figures → Reports
                                              ↓
                                         Shared diagnostics & validation
```
